ONLY SUPPORTS TP-LINK TL-WR840N V6.2 PROCEED WITH CAUTION

OPENWRT VERSION - 21.02.0

I've slightly modified the guide to be for this router and other routers that have a 4MB flash.

For convenience, wifi is enabled by default on first boot. If you do not want this, remove ``./target/linux/ramips/base-files/etc/uci-defaults/99_wireless_config``

Special thanks to [sanitariu](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/support-for-tl-wr840n-ver-6-0/17041/113) , [IcedShake](https://github.com/milankragujevic/openwrt-wr840n-v620-old/blob/master/target/linux/ramips/dts/mt7628an_tplink_tl-wr840n-v6.dts) & [milankragujevic](https://github.com/IcedShake/openwrt-19.07-tl-wr840n-v6.x) for the source files and guides!

 -----------------------------------------------------

This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

To build your own firmware you need a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack
of a case sensitive file system.

You need gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make, find, grep, diff,
unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers installed.

1. Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to obtain all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks for all obtained
packages into package/feeds/

3. Run "make menuconfig" to select your preferred configuration for the
toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

3.1. With the config menu open, select these:
  Target System:  MediaTek Ralink MIPS
  Subtarget:      MT76x8 based boards
  Target Profile: TP-Link TL-WR840N v6.2

3.2. (Optional) Minimal config with LuCi:
 + Change/enable (built-in)     - Disable

 Target Images > squashfs:
   + Block size: 512 (1024 is prefered if bin is still big, slower boot time)

 Global build settings:
   - Cryptographically signed package lists
   - Enable signature checking in opkg
   + Remove ipkg/opkg status data files in final images
   - Enable IPv6 support in packages
   + Strip unnecessary exports from the kernel image
   + Strip unnecessary functions from libraries
   Kernel build options:
     - Compile the kernel with debug filesystem 
       (disable mac80211 DebugFS first)
     - Compile the kernel with symbol table info
     - Compile the kernel with debug info
     + Number of squashfs fragments cached: 1
     + Compiler optimization level: Optimize for size

 Base system:
   - opkg
   - openwrt-keyring
   - libpthread

 Network:
   - ppp
   Web Servers/Proxies:
     + uhttpd (disable if not using LuCi)

 Kernel modules:
   Wireless Drivers > kmod-mac80211:
     - Export mac80211 internals in DebugFS
   Network support:
     - kmod-ppp

 LuCI:
   Modules:
     + luci-base
     + Minify Lua sources
     + luci-mod-admin-full
     + luci-mod-network
     + luci-mod-status
     + luci-mod-system
   Themes:
     + luci-theme-bootstrap

You may also make all kernel modules built-in, saves a bit of image size
and RAM. Be wary that some stuff might break when doing this, so keep a copy
of the kernel .config before doing so.

Kernel config is located at:
./build_dir/target-mipsel_24kc_musl/linux-ramips_mt76x8/linux-5.4.143

Read more at https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/saving_space

4. Run "make" to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build
the cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the Linux kernel & all
chosen applications for your target system.

.bin files are located at ./bin/targets/ramips/mt76x8
If your sysupgrade bin goes over 3.5MB, there will not be enough
space for jffs2 to save. It'll boot, but settings won't persist
between reboots.
